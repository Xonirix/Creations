        <p>An explanation of how the game works</p>
    </div>
    <p>Welcome to Creations! <BR>If you are here you either just started the game or got to a new layer. <br>This is an explanation for EVERY layer, I recommend trying to figure out how things work by yourself first.<br> But if you don't wanna do that then you are in the right place!</p>
    <br>
    <p>PRE-REBIRTH: The beginning of the game! This layer is relatively simple, just Create, however there is one important thing I have to explain, Normal Creations. Normal Creations are quite important to progressing, they multiply your Creation Points per click by 1.5! Just keep Creating and getting Normal Creations and eventually a new button will appear. </p>
    <br>
    <p>REBIRTH: Rebirth is where it gets a bit complicated, there are a lot of things i have to explain. First of all, rebirthing only gives you one Rebirth Point, always, even if you have 20000 when you rebirth you will still get only 1 Rebirth Point. Second, the order in which you buy Creations matters, Creations multiply the Creation Points per Click that you had at the moment you bought them, for example: Lets say you just did your first rebirth, if you buy a Rebirth Creation (x2 Creation Points per Click) and then the first Normal Creation (1.5x Creation Points per Click) you will get less Creation Points per Click than if you did the Normal Creation first and then the Rebirth creation. Last but not least, Matter, Matter is a new resource that will be very useful later on, you get it by lowering your Creation Points per Click by 60, at this stage of the game it's only use is to reset Rebirth Creation price (which is quite useful). That's all i need to explain, just keep progressing and eventually, you will get to the next layer.</p>
